## Configuration

Tanka Docs is configured with two types of files:

- **`tanka-docs.yml`**: This is the main site-wide configuration file. It defines global settings such as the site title, output directory, and specifies where to find documentation sources (e.g., which Git branches and tags to process). For a detailed guide, see [tanka-docs.yml Configuration](xref://project-structure:tanka-docs-yml.md).
- **`tanka-docs-section.yml`**: This file provides section-specific configuration. It's placed within a documentation section's root directory and typically defines the section's ID, title, index page, and navigation structure for that particular section. See [Section Configuration (tanka-docs-section.yml)](xref://project-structure:tanka-docs-section.md) for more details.
